# Light My Way

## Idea

Walking in London at night can be scary - it would be good if your map guides you through streets with less crime and/or better lighting, even if it takes a bit longer than the shortest route!

## Data Source

- [Camden Street Lighting](https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/Environment/Camden-Street-Lighting/dfq3-8wzu)
- [On Street Crime In Camden](https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/Crime-and-Criminal-Justice/On-Street-Crime-In-Camden/qeje-7ve7)
- [DATA.POLICE.UK](https://data.police.uk/data/): Monthly data of on-street crime (only looking at data from City of London Police and Metropolitan Police Service, as focusing on London)
